<h1 align="center">Senp</h1>

Senp is a very simple reactive library based on triggers. It was inspired by [this article](https://www.monterail.com/blog/2016/how-to-build-a-reactive-engine-in-javascript-part-1-observable-objects) and is heavily focused on it.

### üì¶ Installation

Install via npm:
```shell
    npm install senp
```

Use cdn>
```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hipesoft/senp/src/index.js"></script>
```

### üöÄ Usage

One of the most simple yet useful example is changing the value of an element based on click. To do this, you need an html template like this:

```html
    <div id="app">0</div>
    <button onclick="Handleclick()">Click me!</button>
```
And a simple script, that tells the div content to change when the value changes:

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/example-js.png" width="80%" height="80%">
</p>
